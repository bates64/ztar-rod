# what is this

ztar rod is a work-in-progress romhacking tool for [Paper Mario](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Mario).

Tons of credit goes to cloverhax, who did most of the reverse-engineering and released _Star Rod_.
ZR exists as a more performant, featureful (soon, hopefully!) and less buggy alternative to it,
since Clover disappeared.

# usage

You will need:
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)
- A legally-sourced _Paper Mario (USA)_ ROM.

With `Paper Mario (U) [!].z64` in the working-directory:
```sh
$ cargo run
```
