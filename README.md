This is a **work-in-progress**! ZR is currently able to dump most map functions to source-code and
parse it back into an AST.

Tons of credit goes to cloverhax, who did most of the reverse-engineering and released _Star Rod_.
ZR exists as a more performant, featureful (soon, hopefully!) and less buggy alternative to it,
since Clover disappeared.
